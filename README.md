# Rope-Simulation
Tried creating a realistic-ish rope, didn't turn out too bad but there's a ton of room for improvement that I currently don't know how to do, might visit this later.

<strong>Required</strong><br>
Python 2.7-3.8<br>
Pygame 2.0.0.dev6<br>

To use this script use the following commands:
```
pip install pygame

git clone <URL>
cd <REPO NAME>

If you do not want to install any packages, you can also use repl.it to run PyGame scripts!
